# Analyzing LA Open Data

## LA Crime Data 2012 - 2016 (Q1 Only)

Los Angeles police stop data was originally downloaded from data.lacity.org in early 2016 summer (although privileges seemed to have changed recently).

For convenience, a single zipped .csv file is contained in raw_data directory containing all crime data.
